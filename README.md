# CVIP-DATA-SCIENCE
****IMDb Data Analysis Project****
This project focuses on analyzing IMDb (Internet Movie Database) data using Jupyter Notebook. The dataset used for analysis is obtained from Kaggle, specifically the IMDb Datasets collection.

**Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to gain insights into the film industry by analyzing IMDb data. Various analyses are performed, including top-rated movies, genre analysis, actor/director analysis, movie trends over time, and sentiment analysis. The project aims to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the dataset.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for analysis is sourced from Kaggle's IMDb Datasets. It includes comprehensive information about movies, such as titles, release dates, genres, ratings, directors, actors, budgets, and revenues. The dataset is provided in a CSV format and is available for download from the IMDb Datasets collection on Kaggle.

**Requirements**
To run the analysis code, you'll need the following:

Python 3.x,
Jupyter Notebook,
pandas,
matplotlib,
seaborn,
You can install the required Python packages using pip or conda.

**Code Structure**
The analysis code is organized into separate Jupyter Notebook files:

IMDB_Data_Analysis.ipynb: This notebook focuses on data preprocessing tasks, such as data cleaning, handling missing values.
Also, This notebook explores the dataset through various visualizations and statistical analysis. It includes analyses such as top-rated movies, genre distribution, actor/director insights, and trends over time.

**Usage**
To run the Jupyter Notebook files:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip or conda.
Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the cloned repository directory.
Run each notebook file (*.ipynb) in sequential order.
Make sure to adjust the file paths within the notebooks if necessary, depending on the location of the dataset.

**Results**
The analysis results, insights, and visualizations are presented within the Jupyter Notebook file. Each notebook file contains detailed explanations and interpretations of the findings.

**Contributions**
Contributions to this project are welcome. Feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue if you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional analyses to contribute.
