**Phase - 1: Task - 2 [Golden Task]: House Price Prediction**
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting house prices based on various features. The model is built using Python and utilizes a popular regression algorithm to provide accurate predictions.

**Introduction**
Predicting house prices is a common task in the real estate industry, and machine learning models can help provide accurate estimates. This project aims to leverage historical data to build a regression model that predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors.

**Dataset**
#MagicBricks dataset link in kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neelkamal692/delhi-house-price-prediction

**Model Training**
To train the model using MagicBricks dataset the following steps are performed:

Preparing our dataset in a suitable format. Ensure that it includes the necessary features and the corresponding house prices.

Split our dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.

Train the model using the training set. The model will learn patterns and relationships between the input features and the house prices.

Evaluate the model using the testing set. This step assesses the model's performance by comparing its predictions to the actual house prices in the testing set.

By doing experiment with different algorithms like Linear Regression, hyperparameters, or feature engineering techniques to improve the model's accuracy.

**Usage**
To predict house prices using the pre-trained model, follow these steps:

Preparing our input data in a suitable format. Ensure that the input features align with the requirements of the model.

Load the pre-trained model weights. The weights contain the learned information from the training process.

Use the model to predict house prices based on the input data. The model will apply the learned patterns to make predictions.

Analyzing and interpret the predicted house prices. Consider factors such as location, area, and other relevant features to gain insights from the predictions.

**Evaluation**
The evaluation of the model can be done by computing various performance metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or R-mean squared error(RMSE). These metrics help assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictions. Additionally, visualizations like scatter plots or residual plots can provide insights into the model's performance.
